# DEX Experiment

This project is a test to see if I can recreate a Uniswap V1 pool by only using the formalized documentation of a constant product market maker.

https://github.com/runtimeverification/verified-smart-contracts/blob/uniswap/uniswap/x-y-k.pdf

The first iteration of the contract will have no fees and liquidity will already be provided in the pool. The second iteration will allow users to diposit liquidity and earn trading fees from the pool from LP tokens.
